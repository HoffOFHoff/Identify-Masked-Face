# Identify-Masked-Face
This is a facial identification project for the EN.540.635 “Software Carpentry”. People need to maintain a certain social distance within the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, people have to wear mask. So in our project, we create a platform where the identification of masked face is possible.   



# Project Topic:
We will XXXXXXXXXXX
Here is the three milestone need to be overcome in our project.  
1.Face identification.  
2.Mask the face.  
3.Identify the Masked face.  



#### The procedure of 1.Face identification:

#### The procedure of 2.Mask the face:

#### The procedure of 3.Identify the Masked face:
1.Get the raw facial data.  
2.Find the 68 point.  
3.Identify important point.  
4.Find mask and mask the face.  
5.Use machine learning method to identify the face.  
6.Input the real face.  
7.Modify the face angle, mask fit, lighting conditions.  
8.Face_masked detection.

## Environment Organization
We use python 3.6 as our language.
The basic toolboxs（such as Caffe、TensorFlow and Torch/PyTorch in OpenCV）need to be pip in the python system.
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install pytesseract
pip install torch torchvision
pip install python-utils
```
